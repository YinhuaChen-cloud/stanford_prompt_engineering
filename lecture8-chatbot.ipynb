    "\n",
    "这有一些很好的用途，例如你可以将大型语言模型用作头脑风暴的合作伙伴。但是我也要承认，这方面存在一些有问题的使用案例，例如如果有人使用它产生大量垃圾邮件。因此，当你使用大型语言模型的这些能力时，请以负责任的方式来使用，以有助于人的方式来使用。\n",

    "在本课程的视频中，我们一直在使用 temperature=0。我认为如果你试图建立一个可靠的和可预测的系统，你就应该使用 temperature=0。而如果你希望模型更有创造性，你可能想获得更加多样性的不同输出，你可能需要使用更高的温度参数。\n",

    "那么，现在让我们使用刚才使用的相同提示，并尝试生成一封电子邮件，但让我们使用更高的温度参数。我们在视频中一直使用的 get_completion 函数中，已经指定了模型和温度参数，但我们此前是将其设置为默认值。现在，让我们试着改变温度值。\n",
